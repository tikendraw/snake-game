# Snake Game 
Welcome to the Snake Game! üêç

This is a simple snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It's a classic game where you control a snake and try to eat apples while avoiding collision with the walls and yourself.

## How to Play
1. **Install Pygame**: Make sure you have Pygame installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install pygame
    ```

2. **Run the Game**: Execute the snake_game.py script in your Python environment.
    ```
    python3 snake.py  
    ```
    or 
    ```
    python3 snake2.py
    ```

3. **Game Rules**:

    * Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
    * Your goal is to eat as many apples as possible to increase your score.
    * The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

4. **Scoring**: Each apple you eat increases your score.

5. **Game Over**: When the game ends, you will see a "Game Over" message along with your score.

6. **Restart**: You can play again by running the game script once more.
